        <p>The menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes a woman's body goes through in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy. Each month, one of the ovaries releases an egg â€” a process called ovulation. At the same time, hormonal changes prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If ovulation takes place and the egg isn't fertilized, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is a menstrual period.</p></th>

          <h2>How can the risk of abnormal menstruation (periods) be reduced?</h2>
       <li>Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising moderately and eating nutritious foods. If you have to lose weight, do so      gradually instead of turning to diets that drastically limit your calorie and food intake.
        Make sure you get enough rest.</li>
        <li>Practice stress reduction and relaxation techniques.</li>
        <li>If you are an athlete, cut back on prolonged or intense exercise routines. Excessive sports activities can cause irregular periods.</li>
           <li> Use birth control pills or other contraceptive methods as directed.</li>
        <li>Change your tampons or sanitary napkins approximately every four to six hours to avoid toxic shock syndrome and prevent      infections.
            See a doctor for regular check-ups.</li></th>
